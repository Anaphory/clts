# Sources employed in CLTS

## PBase (Mielke 2008)

The file is originally taken from the Windows-Version of an PBase, where the inventory was listed. The file was modified slightly and we use it now solely to generate the link to the website of the Project.

## Ruhlen's Global Linguistic Database (Ruhlen 2008)

The data has been downloaded from the URL of the project, and we have tried to clean it as good as possible, to have a consistent representation. We select only those sounds which occur at least in 5 different languages, and we generally ignore the clicks, as the representation is rather idiosyncratic and we do not know how to interpret them.

## Phoible (Moran et al. 2014)

We employ the latest dump of the Phoible data and provide the link to the website via the identifiers. We do not currently replicate the Phoible feature system.

## Eurasian Phonological Database (Nicolaev 2017)

We use the data from the JSON-dump provided by the editors and offer the URL to browse the data.

## LAPSYD

We created a dump of the data by browsing the segments. As the database does not offer any API, we cannot link to it, but we show the features that are being used internally in the project.
